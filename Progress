Project title
Laser detector sends message to phone after tripped

#### what have you done for the project so far?

i have made the physical laser detector stystem using a Arduino board. I am now coding in Arduino for alerts when the laser is tripped.

#### What have i not done for the project?
I have not been able to send the message, might have to find a different way to alert the person instead of a text message. 

### what problems, if any, have you encountered??
the main problem is learning how to code on the Arduino because it is different from phython. I also had problems with setting up the physical laser detector.
