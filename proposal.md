# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Laser Detection Stystem

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Looking to code a laser dection stystem that will alert the user when it had been tripped. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

my software will require name, email, as well as a physical laser. if the laser is broken then an email should be sent to the user to allert them of the wire trip. it will be exucuted by coding a reaction to the laser to alert the user. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I belive that I will be able to code the reaction of the broken laser as well as storing the email and name of the person using it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to alert the user through email as well as storing the time and data of the intruder. Also should be able to reset the laser and alert the intruder again if the laser is broken.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome is alerting the user and storing all the data at the current time. it should also be able to reset after the first email and countiune to send emails and alert whenever the laser is broken.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to be able to connect the laser to the program itself to allow for the alert when the laser is broken. i will need to research topics of coding that will be able to store and send data based on breaking the laser. other things that will be researched are the physical laser outputs that are recived by the computer.
